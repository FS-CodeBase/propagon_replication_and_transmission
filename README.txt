% Simulating Data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The example script Example_Simulate_Data.m shows how to generate simulated
data using the functions in the /code/ folder.

% Parameter Estimation 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The example script Example_Parameter_Estimation.m shows how to apply the
adaptive Metropolis algorithm with functions from the /code/ folder to 
propagon count data (both simulated data and experimental data).
